<h1 align="center">ðŸš°IoT Smart River Monitoring</h1>

<p align="left">
This is a project made for the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/400396">IoT course</a> of the Computer Science and Engineering Bachelor's Degree at the University of Bologna. It's meant to simulate the management of a river's water levels through a dam. The project is made of four components: a backend application made in Java using the Vert.x framework; an online dashboard made in Javascript; a C++ application made for Arduino to manage the valve of the river; and another C++ application made for ESP32 to manage the sensors of the river. Details about the structure of the system, as well as screenshots of the dashboard, can be found in the report.
