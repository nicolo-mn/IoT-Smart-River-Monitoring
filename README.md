<h1 align="center">ðŸš°IoT Smart River Monitoring</h1>

<p align="left">
This system is meant to simulate the management of a river's water levels through a dam. It is made of four components: a backend application made in Java using the Vert.x framework; an online dashboard made in Javascript; a C++ application made for Arduino to manage the valve of the river; and another C++ application made for ESP32 to manage the sensors of the river. Details about the structure of the system can be found in the report. A screenshot of the dashboard can be seen below. <br/><br/>This is a project made for the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/400396">IoT course</a> of the Computer Science and Engineering Bachelor's Degree at the University of Bologna.
